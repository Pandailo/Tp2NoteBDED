 ===============================


Application Overview:
----------------------

This application aims to demonstrate the JOnAS's clustering features in a 'pedagogic' way:

- load balancing at Apache level
	. mod_jk
- failover at the web level (Tomcat)
	. HTTP session replication
- load balancing at EJB3 level
	. CMI
- failover at EJB level
	. Stateful EJB3 replication


For a complete description of the application and the cluster configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

See http://jonas.objectweb.org/JONAS_5_1_0/doc/doc-en/html/clustering_guide.html


Configuring the clustering:
---------------------------

First of all, configure the cluster using the newjc command.
Please, refer to the newjc documentation and do not forget to install and configure apache2
as it's described in the Cluster Configuration Guide.


Compiling this application:
---------------------------

Use the Ant build tool:
- ant ear


Running the application:
-------------------------

1) Start the cluster:

Use for that, the jcl4sc (jcl4sc.bat) command generated by newjc in the root
of the JOnAS bases.

  jcl4sc -c start

This allows to start the cluster, included the cluster daemon, the db node,
the master node and the jbx nodes.

2) Deploy the application:

The sampleCluster3 application is automatically deployed on the cluster if you
have previously build it, before using the jcl4sc command.


3) Test the application

Use your webbrowser
    url: http://<hostname>:<apache-port>/sampleCluster3
    ex : http://localhost:80/sampleCluster3

4) Stop the cluster:

jcl4sc stop

This allows to stop the cluster.


You may type jcl4sc -help to get the usage of the command.

Good luck!!
