JAX-WS sample
-------------
This example shows how to access to a webservice deployed via a web application (quote.ear).
The web service is implemented by an annotated POJO  (QuoteReporterPoOJO)
A java client launched by the client container calls ten times the web service and prints results

The service directory contains :
    - the POJO QuoteReporterPoOJO that implements QuoteReporter interface that needs the quote class
    - an application.xml descriptor in order to package an enterprise application quote.ear
    - an empty web.xml descriptor in order to package a web application quote.war
The client directory contains:
    - the main class QuoteMain that access to the web service

In order to run this example JOnAS must be launched with ejb3, jaxws, web and ear services

##################################################
To build and deploy the application quote.ear do:
    1. ant clean build-deploy-service
    2. ant run-client
##################################################
    
The target build-deploy:
    - compiles the services classes, build the quote.ear and put it under $JONAS_BASE/deploy.
     when quote.ear is deployed by JOnAS a WSDL is created and published at the following URL:
        http://localhost:9000/quote/QuoteReporterService?WSDL
    
The target run-client:
    - creates the artifacts needs by the client from the published WSDL, compiles the corresponding classes
      and package the whole in a quote-client.jar client application
    - runs quote-client.jar using the container client and executes the main class QuoteMain
    - prints the result in the shell of the client
